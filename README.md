# Trigger-a-Custom-Rule-in-Suricata-
I ran Suricata on a captured network traffic file (sample.pcap) using a custom rule that detects HTTP GET requests. The output in fast.log shows that the rule triggered twice, indicating that the sample.pcap file contained two HTTP GET requests that matched the rule's criteria.
